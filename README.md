# RangeTime
A full-stack web application that calculates your last 5 rounds of golf to give you the best, customized way to spend time at the range.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, MongoDB, EJS, Node.js

Here is my simple golf app. All you need to do is log down the details of your game (tee shots, approach shots, chips, putts, etc.) as you play a round. Then, the algorithm, taking the last 5 rounds you've played, will tell you how much time you need spend on each part of your game at the range. It'll give you your personalized RangeTime :) And as your game changes, so will your practice sessions.

I started this project because I found my game plateauing. So, I thought I'd start by finding the worst part of my game and improving only that. But it was hard to remember all my mistakes after finishing, so I created this app to log down every aspect of my game in real time. This way, I wont have to guess.

## Optimizations

Currently working on getting rid of all ejs and using React instead for the views
